## Installation

Go to this link (still implementing).

## Usage

Click on the Chrome icon then check your question.

## Raison d'être

Everybody becomes happy with better questions. They yield better answers and just makes the internet (world) better. :sunglasses:

English is my third language and I have been drilled by the strict rule of asking ["wh" type questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question#wh) and respecting the structure:

1. (what || where || how || why || who || when)
2. question mark `?` at the end.

I still think that this structure just prompts you in asking better questions.
